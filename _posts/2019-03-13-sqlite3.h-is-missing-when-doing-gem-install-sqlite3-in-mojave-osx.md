Fetching sqlite3 1.3.12
Installing sqlite3 1.3.12 with native extensions
Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... no
sqlite3.h is missing. Try 'brew install sqlite3',
'yum install sqlite-devel' or 'apt-get install libsqlite3-dev'
and check your shared library search path (the
location where your sqlite3 shared library is located).
*** extconf.rb failed ***
Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary
libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.
```

If `gem install sqlite3` fails, you probably:

* Haven't agreed to XCode license: `xcode-select --install`
* Missing sqlite3 homebrew package. You can do with `brew install sqlite3`
* Need to install with `gem install sqlite3 -- --with-sqlite3-dir=/opt/local`
