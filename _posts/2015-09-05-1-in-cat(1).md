When you do `man cat`, you get an output like:

    CAT(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   CAT(1)

    NAME
        cat -- concatenate and print files

Ever wonder what the 1 in `CAT(1)` stands for? It's the section for command as defined in [Unix Programmer's manual](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/v7vol1.pdf). Here're the sections:

    1. Commands
    2. System calls
    3. Subroutines
    4. Special files
    5. File formats and conventions
    6. Games
    7. Macro packages and language conventions
    8. Maintenance
