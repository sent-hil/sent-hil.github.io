This link collection is predominantly filesystems; they have been mostly on my mind the last couple weeks, especially network and virtual filesytems like Camilstore, Infinit Storage and Tahoe-LAFS. There are ton of options, but there is also plenty of oppurtunities.

* [Camlistore](https://camlistore.org) - personal storage system for life; stands for Content-Addressable Multi-Layer Indexed Storage, the idea is to dump whatever you prefer onto it (objects, files etc.) and access them with various interfaces (browser, fuse, phone etc.)
* [Keybase](https://keybase.io) - maps your identity to your public keys; similar to what Github is to git. I am https://keybase.io/senthil196. They also have keybase-filesystem which is "Public, signed directories for everyone in the world". It sounds interesting, waiting for my invite to kbfs.
* [Infinit Storage](http://infinit.sh/) - decentralized software‑based file storage platform
* [Tahoe-LAFS](https://www.tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs) - free and Open decentralized cloud storage system; preceds Infinit Storage.
* [Reed–Solomon error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction) - group of error-correcting codes; has multipe use cases, including in data storage where it is used to detect corrupted data and correct upto x data based on original configuration.
* [A Distributed Systems Reading List](https://dancres.github.io/Pages) - looks promising, hoping to go through them soon.
