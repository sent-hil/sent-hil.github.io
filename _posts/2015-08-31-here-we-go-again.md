It's been a while since I've maintained a blog seriously. After flirting with Ghost, Medium and even Github's gists, I settled on Jekyll for its ease of use and customization. This is going to be a more of a braindump, somewhere between Twitter and Medium.

Like most Jekyll blog this too is hosted on [Github](https://github.com). You can view the source [here](https://github.com/sent-hil/sent-hil.github.io). The design is originally from [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io). I forked the original repo and made some minor changes.
