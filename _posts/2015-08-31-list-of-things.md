* [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv): Folder specific env variable config; especially useful for managing multiple `GOPATH` and `GOBIN`.
* [multiconfig](https://github.com/koding/multiconfig): Load configuration from multiple sources in Go; Only thing missing is ability to specify description for various config.
* [Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X): The best self help book isn't a self help book at all. It's more of an inquiry into how habits are formed and how to change them. In one of the chapters, there's talk of 'keystone habit', ie something that enables you to change your life for the better. Usually it's exercise. But for me it's putting everything into writing. Goals, lists, todos etc.
