<p>Consistent hashing is deceptively simple yet very powerful, but I didn’t quite
understand what it was till I sat down and worked it out for myself. Before I
tell you about consistent hashing, you need to understand the problem we’re
trying to solve:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1440/1*AHzeEycsTXnNAkgojeixxA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>How to determine which server to store and retrieve keys in a distributed
network? Requirements are: all nodes get relatively equal number of keys, be
able to add and remove nodes such as fewest number of keys are moved around.</p>

<p>Let’s assume couple things: There are four servers in the network: Chico, Harpo,
Groucho and Zeppo. All four servers are identical, but have no knowledge of each
other.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1440/1*JSsWI9-0SS35tKX6GjmaDg.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To keep things simple in this example the keys are incrementing integers.
Usually you run the key against a checksum to return a number. Once you have
that number, you can take the modulo of that number against the number of nodes.
This works surprisingly when the network is stable, ie no nodes are leaving or
joining the network.</p>

<p>But, what happens if a node, ie Harpo goes down, like he’s always prone to
doing. Then we’ve a big problem. Using the same hash function, we get the same
result, but apply modulo operation we get different results than before, since
the number of nodes is reduced by one.</p>

<p>Note how nearly all the keys from all nodes need to be remapped as well. This
make no sense, why should the keys that in servers that are functioning properly
have to be remapped?! Do you share my exclamation yet? Well now we’ve arrived at
the need for consistent hashing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Consistent hashing</strong> is a special kind of hashing such that when a hash table
is resized and consistent hashing is used, only K/n keys need to be remapped on
average, where K is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots.<br />
Source:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we had used consistent hashing above, then only the keys from Harpo need to
be moved around. Usually this is when most posts include a picture of an unit
circle and explain it in terms of that. Let’s do it:</p>

<p>For time being ignore how the nodes were placed onto the unit circle. Instead of
applying modulo function on the hash of the key, let’s map the hash onto the
unit circle. (I know this is hand waving, but we’ll get to the implementation
soon enough). To determine which node the key maps to, we simply go clockwise
till we find a node. So for key 1, Harpo is the node it should be stored and
retrieved from.</p>

<p>So what if Harpo goes down? You’ll need to get and retrieve key 1 from a
different node, however note how rest of the key mappings haven’t changed. The
only keys that have changed are the ones that used to live in Harpo node. Voila!
This works if you add new nodes as well. Say you add Gummo to the network. You
don’t need to change the residence of existing keys.</p>

<p>Consistent hashing also covers situations where nodes differ in size. What you
do is create virtual nodes and make them onto the unit circle. Depending on the
hash function you chose, the virtual nodes can be made to place randomly on the
unit circle. For nodes with more capacity, you should add more virtual nodes.
This way when a node goes down, the keys are distributed evenly across other
nodes, not just to the next one.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>

<p>Let’s go the extra mile here and implement a consistent hash library in Go. I
didn’t quite understand it till I found a good implementation and put print
statements everywhere and changed the code. This implementation is heavily
inspired by <a href="https://github.com/stathat/consistent">stathat’s</a> implementation.
The original paper calls for using trees for implementation, however I prefer
the way stathat did it.</p>

<p>Let’s define a bird’s eye view:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// Initializes new distribute network of nodes or a ring.
func NewRing() *Ring

// Adds node to the ring.
func (r *Ring) AddNode(id string)

// Removes node from the ring if it exists, else returns
// ErrNodeNotFound.
func (r *Ring) RemoveNode(id string) error

// Gets node which is mapped to the key. Return value is identifer
// of the node given in `AddNode`.
func (r *Ring) Get(key string) string
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll use <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/hash/crc32/">crc32</a> for generating a
checksum of the key. Explaining what crc32 does and how it does it is beyond
scope of this blog post. Just know that given an input, it returns a 32 uint.
Input in this case is the ipaddress of the node.</p>

<p>The gist of it is we use an array to hold the result of node id checksums. For
each key we run the checksum and determine the position the key should be added
and return the node closet to that. If it’s out of bounds of array, we return
the first node.</p>

<p>First, let’s define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ring</code>, which is just a collection of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>package consistenthash

// Ring is a network of distributed nodes.
type Ring struct {
  Nodes Nodes
}

// Nodes is an array of nodes.
type Nodes []Node

// Node is a single entity in a ring.
type Node struct {
 Id     string
 HashId uint32
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, let’s write the initializer functions for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ring</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>package consistenthash

func NewRing() *Ring {
  return &amp;Ring{Nodes : Nodes{}}
}

func NewNode(id string) *Node{
  return &amp;Node{
    Id        : id,
    hashedKey : crc32.Checksum([]byte(id)),
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re finally ready to fill in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AddNode</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>func (r *Ring) AddNode(id string) {
  node := NewNode(id)
  r.Nodes = append(r.Nodes, node)

  sort.Sort(r.Nodes)
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort.Sort</code>? This goes back to the unit circle. How exactly do you implement
an unit circle? One way is to have an array with the last item pointing to the
first item in the entry. We can use a linked list for this, but you’ll see soon
enough why that’s unnecessary.</p>

<p>If you run what we’ve so far, Go compiler will throw something at you because
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Nodes</code> doesn’t implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort.Sort</code> interface. That’s pretty easy to do:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>package consistenthash

func (n Nodes) Len() int           { return len(n) }
func (n Nodes) Less(i, j int) bool { return n[i].HashId &lt; n[j].HashId }
func (n Nodes) Swap(i, j int)      { n[i], n[j] = n[j], n[i] }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s continue with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Get</code> which is the point of this all:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>func (r *Ring) Get(key string) string {
  searchfn := func(i int) bool {
    return r.Nodes[i].HashId &gt;= crc32.Checksum([]byte(key))
  }

  i := sort.Search(r.Nodes.Len(), searchfn)
  if i &gt;= r.Nodes.Len() {
    i = 0
  }

  return r.Nodes[i].Id
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Search"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort.Search</code></a> uses binary search to find
exitense of node in array. If it doesn’t exist, it returns the place where the
node should be added if we were to add it. If the node cheksum is greater than
the last node, then we add it to the first node. And that’s it.</p>

<p>If you want to check the rest of the code, it’s open sourced
<a href="https://github.com/sent-hil/consistenthash">here</a>, along with some tests.</p>

<p>Remember how it told you in the beginning consistent hashing was deceptively
simple, yet powerful? Believe me yet? You should know consistent hashing was
first introduce in a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CFIQFjAG&amp;url=http://www.akamai.com/dl/technical_publications/ConsistenHashingandRandomTreesDistributedCachingprotocolsforrelievingHotSpotsontheworldwideweb.pdf&amp;ei=6IVAVbq9HcX6oQThqYHgDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2IBIOHYdoFYZae_kJsR4-H-_m-A&amp;bvm=bv.91665533,d.cGU">paper by
Akamai</a>
who know a thing or two about distributed systems. An improved version of
consistent hashing is used in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer)">Chord</a> algorithm which is a
distributed hash table. (earlier version said Chord is behind Amazon dynamodb,
<a href="https://twitter.com/ernesto_jimenez/status/593550482737635328">which is
incorrect.</a>)</p>

<p>I’m still in the process of reading and understanding chord, not to mention
implementing it myself, will do a blog post here once that’s done. I had a lot
of fun learning about consistent hashing, implementing it, not to mention
writing this blog post, hope you learned a thing or do. If you find an error or
think something can be said better, you can tweet me @sent-hil.</p>
