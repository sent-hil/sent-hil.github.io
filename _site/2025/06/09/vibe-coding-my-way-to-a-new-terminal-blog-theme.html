<p class="meta">09 June, 2025</p>

<p>I was very inspired by recent <a href="https://x.com/sh_reya/status/1931119169929703827">post</a> by <a href="https://x.com/sh_reya/status/1931400666003784008">Shreya Shankar</a> where she tweeted about vibe coding interfaces to look at the data. In her follow up <a href="https://x.com/sh_reya/status/1931400666003784008">post</a> she gave some tips about how to get the clean terminal look. Turns out it’s as simple as telling Claude ‘sleek terminal theme’.</p>

<p>So last night while lying in bed with my phone I told Claude</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to build a text introduction site for a developer with some intro text. I want the text to be inside a terminal mimicking a cli. Assume we are using a dark iterm theme in mac. Make the terminal appear in center of screen with plenty of room for it to grow. Let’s start with just html and css</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The results were way better than I expected:</p>

<p>I downloaded the resulting html, asked Claude Code to adapt the theme to use in this Jekyll blog. It took a few minutes and about ~$0.40, yes cents. Updating this blog theme was perhaps the last item on my todo list, with Claude it took me about an hour. I just had to clean up few css styles and that’s it. I honestly didn’t think it woudl work on first try.</p>

<p>Do I care about the quality of this code? Not really. It’s a site that got 37 visits last month. I can’t imagine doing this for production code though.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long before LLMs get good enough to put software engineers out of a job, but it does raise the bar of what someone can create with just a few dollars, enough knowledge to make good choices, and good taste.</p>

<p>It’s like when photographers got the ability to see the picture they took on a digital screen. It reduced the feedback cycle between shutter and seeing the photo, and made it accessible to a whole new subset of people. LLMs make writing code accessible to anyone with a computer and few cents.</p>

<p>This is what my site looks like after replacing the lorem ipsum with my data.</p>
