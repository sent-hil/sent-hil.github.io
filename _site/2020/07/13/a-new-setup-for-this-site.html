<p>Last July 4th weekend I took some time to redo the setup for sent-hil.com. Previously it was Jekyll app running on Github pages. For the amount of blogging I did and traffic it received, it was more than enough. However I wanted to convert sent-hil.com to be a hub for different apps. My first attempt was to use AWS ECS to deploy dockers containers, but after couple days of struggling I gave up. I tried GCP, which was more fruitful, but ultimately I ran into some technical issues.</p>

<p>At that point I gave up wth a hosted solution and started looking around for a DIY solution and ultimately found <a href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/">dokku</a>. It took couple hours to figure it out and this is the <a href="https://github.com/sent-hil/sent-hil.com">result of it</a></p>

<p>The repo contains the following folders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>terraform - contains terraform scripts to bring up a VPC with RDS and EC2 instance.</li>
  <li>blog - Jekyll app that powers the root <a href="sent-hil.com">sent-hil.com</a> (public).</li>
  <li>graph - <a href="https://hasura.io">Hasura</a> app (private).</li>
  <li>stats - <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com">Goatcounter</a> app (private) for analytics.</li>
</ul>

<p>To deploy I do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push dokku master</code>.</p>

<h2 id="downsides">Downsides</h2>

<p>This setup is horizontally challenged. dokku has some support for K8/Nomad, but it seems experiemental and I couldn’t find documentation to get started. This setup will last me for a long time. Worst case I will vertically scale the instance.</p>

<p>Overrall I’m pretty happy with the setup. It’s fairly easy to manage, cheap and I can always ssh into the instance to debug. That’s something I sorely missed when trying to work with the hosted solutions.</p>
